# Rules for pushdown automata have the following properties.

# The state, character and next_state need to match the current configuration of the machine in order for the rule to be applied
# - state           : the state the rule can act on (1, 2, 3, etc)
# - pop_character   : needs to match the topmost stack character ('(', ')', etc)
# - character       : needs to match the next input character

# - next_state      : if the rule applies, the machine should move to the specified state
# - push_characters : after the pop_character gets popped off the stack (when moving to the next_state), these characters are pushed

# This example is to introduce the concept of following a rule. If the machine is in a fit configuration, so that the rule applies,
# move to the next configuration.
